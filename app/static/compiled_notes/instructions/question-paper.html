<p>Here's the YAML version of the quiz questions:</p>
<p>```yaml:study_notes_app/quizzes/atomic_structure.yaml
- question: "What is the wavelength of light emitted when the electron in a hydrogen atom drops from n = 4 to n = 2 level? (Given Rydberg constant R = 1.097 × 10⁷ m⁻¹)"
  options:
    - "486 nm"
    - "656 nm"
    - "410 nm"
    - "364 nm"
  correct_answer: "410 nm"</p>
<ul>
<li>question: "Which of the following correctly describes the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle?"
  options:<ul>
<li>"It is impossible to simultaneously measure the exact momentum and position of an electron."</li>
<li>"Electrons can only exist at quantized energy levels."</li>
<li>"The uncertainty principle applies only to the hydrogen atom."</li>
<li>"Electrons always move in circular orbits around the nucleus."
  correct_answer: "It is impossible to simultaneously measure the exact momentum and position of an electron."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<pre class="codehilite"><code>Rules for creating more YAML quiz files:

1. File Format:
   - Use `.yaml` or `.yml` file extension.
   - Place the files in the `quizzes` directory.

2. Structure:
   - Each question is an item in a list, starting with a dash (`-`).
   - Each question has three main keys: `question`, `options`, and `correct_answer`.

3. Question Format:
   - The `question` key contains the full text of the question.
   - Use double quotes (`&quot;`) to enclose the question text, especially if it contains special characters.

4. Options:
   - The `options` key contains a list of possible answers.
   - Each option starts with a dash (`-`) and is enclosed in double quotes.
   - Provide at least two options, typically four.

5. Correct Answer:
   - The `correct_answer` key contains the correct option.
   - It must match exactly one of the options provided.

6. Formatting:
   - Use proper YAML indentation (typically 2 spaces).
   - For multiline text, use the `&gt;` symbol and indent the following lines.

7. Special Characters:
   - If using special characters or symbols, enclose the text in double quotes.
   - For very complex formatting, you can use the `|` symbol for literal block scalar.

8. Grouping:
   - You can group related questions in the same file.
   - Use descriptive file names for different topics or difficulty levels.

9. Metadata (optional):
   - You can add metadata at the top of the file, such as:
     ```yaml
     ---
     topic: Atomic Structure
     difficulty: Intermediate
     total_questions: 50
     ---
     ```

10. Consistency:
    - Maintain a consistent style and format throughout the file and across different quiz files.

Example of a complex question:

```yaml
- question: &gt;
    &quot;Calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron moving at 5.97 × 10⁶ m/s:
    (Given: h = 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s, mₑ = 9.109 × 10⁻³¹ kg)&quot;
  options:
    - &quot;1.22 × 10⁻¹⁰ m&quot;
    - &quot;2.44 × 10⁻¹⁰ m&quot;
    - &quot;4.88 × 10⁻¹⁰ m&quot;
    - &quot;9.76 × 10⁻¹⁰ m&quot;
  correct_answer: &quot;1.22 × 10⁻¹⁰ m&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>By following these rules, you can create consistent and easily parseable quiz files in YAML format.</p>
